WORK IN PROGRESS: The point of this project is to be coded “live” in logical steps while a student (with no previous knowledge of coding) watches.

TO DO:

- split client and assassin into two sections, each one runs the same elimination attempts
- fix achillesHeel property (make message about it display correctly)
- stop trying elimination techniques as soon as one of them works
- add more explanatory comments
- fix eliminate function
- add more console.log statements to report on the results of each random-chance roll
