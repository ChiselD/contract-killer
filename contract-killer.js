// Explanation of how coding works

// Programming language used is JavaScript

// Scenario is this: You are a real bastard. You make enemies as easy
// as blinking, and people are constantly hiring contract killers to
// take you out. You have an established routine for dealing with these
// assassination attempts. When you find out that there's a contract
// out on you (yet again) you send your trusty spy to find out certain
// pieces of information for you.
// Based on this information, you follow the routine below to take
// care of the situation and save your ass.


// Data in the following section (variables) changes in each case!
//=========================================================
// Your spy returns, bearing the following information:
var assassin = {
	name: "John Q. Smith",
	blackmailable: false,
	achillesHeel: "unknown"
